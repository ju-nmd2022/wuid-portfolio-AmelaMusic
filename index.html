          My name is Amela Music and I am from Nässjö, Sweden. I am a 22 year
          old new media design student at Jönköping University. On my free time
          I like to spend time with family and friends. I also like to travel,
          work out and listen to music.

        <h2>Why study new media design?</h2>
        <article>
          I have always liked the idea of working in media related areas.
          Designing websites/posters and coding have amongst other things always
          seemed interesting to me. I applied for the civil engineer program in
          media technology in Stockholm and studied that for about 1,5 years
          before deciding to drop out after realising it wasn't for me. I then
          looked for other media related programs and found the new media design
          in Jönköping. It had many interesting subjects and no math or physics
          which was a big relief. It is also close to where I live and seemed to
          be the perfect option.
