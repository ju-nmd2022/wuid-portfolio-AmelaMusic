        This assignment was in the course fundimentals of graphic design. The
        assignment consists of taking a picture, an object or a concept and
        simplify it. It could be a pictogram, an ideogram, an icon or a
        minimalistic poster. The design was done as vector graphics using
        illustrator. This design was a "popular culture stylization" taking
        inspiration from the movie black panther.
